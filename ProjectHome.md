The Ion Beam at the University of Wisconsin was upgraded to use three picoamp meters (two dual-channel, one single channel), a multiplexer, a multifunction data acquisition board, a new computer, and a touchscreen interface for the radiation damage stage and chamber. The new hardware is used to monitor five currents: sample current and four beam defining apertures, the terminal voltage, vacuum pressures along the beam line, beam profile, and sample temperatures.

A LabVIEW application was created to monitor and control the new hardware and provide a simple, easy-to-use graphical interface. The new software interface replaces an old software interface and hardware controls, which allows for the importing and exporting of SRIM simulation files and experiment files. Alarms have been added to alert end users to failures along the beam line.
